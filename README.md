Astro Data Visualization
Simple Python scripts for visualizing astronomical data. This repository is for personal educational projects and explorations.

plot_light_curve.py
A script to generate and plot a sample light curve for a star from the Kepler mission dataset.

Features
Generates synthetic data mimicking a real stellar light curve with a planetary transit.
Uses standard scientific libraries: NumPy for data handling and Matplotlib for plotting.
Saves the resulting plot as a PNG file.

Usage
To run the script, you need Python and the following libraries installed:

Bash

pip install numpy matplotlib
Then, simply run the script from your terminal:

Bash

python plot_light_curve.py
This will generate a plot named light_curve_8462852.png.
